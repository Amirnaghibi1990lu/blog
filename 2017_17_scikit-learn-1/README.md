The material is based on my workshop at Berkeley - [Machine learning with scikit-learn](https://github.com/qingkaikong/20170628_ML_sklearn). I convert it here so that there will be more explanation. Note that, the code is written using **Python 3.6**. It is better to read the slides I have first, which you can find it [here](http://qingkaikong.blogspot.com/2017/06/machine-learning-12-machine-learning.html). You can find the notebook on [Qingkai's Github](https://github.com/qingkaikong/blog/tree/master/2017_17_scikit-learn-1).  

# Scikit-learn Basics

In the next few weeks, we will introduce scikit-learn, a popular package containing a collection of tools for machine learning written in Python. See more at http://scikit-learn.org. It has many existing algorithms that implemented and tested by many volunteers, therefore, before you decide to write some algorithms by yourself, check if it is already there. 

The first thing when you build a working machine learning algorithm, you need data. You can always start with your own data from specific problems, but you can also first build a prototype using existing data that already included in scikit-learn.

## Loading an example dataset

Let's start by loading some [pre-existing datasets](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets) in the scikit-learn, which comes with a few standard datasets. For example, the [iris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) and [digits](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pen-Based+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits) datasets for classification and the [boston house prices](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing) dataset for regression. Using these existing datasets, we can easily test the algorithms that we are interested in. 

A dataset is a dictionary-like object that holds all the data and some metadata about the data. This data is stored in the .data member, which is a n\_samples, n\_features array. In the case of supervised problem, one or more response variables are stored in the .target member. More details on the different datasets can be found in the dedicated section.

### Load iris

The iris dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.


| [![Iris Setosa](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Kosaciec_szczecinkowaty_Iris_setosa.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_setosa)  | [![Iris Virginica](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Iris_virginica.jpg/1920px-Iris_virginica.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_virginica) | [![Iris Versicolor](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Blue_Flag%2C_Ottawa.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_versicolor) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

from sklearn import datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

plt.style.use('seaborn-poster')
%matplotlib inline
```


```python
# load the data
iris = datasets.load_iris()

print(iris.keys())
```

    dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names'])


There are five keys here, and data and target are storing the data and the label we are interested. feature\_names and target\_names are the corresponding header names. The DESCR has a list of information about this dataset. Let's print out each one of them and have a look. 


```python
print(iris.feature_names)
# only print the first 10 samples
print(iris.data[:10])
print('We have %d data samples with %d features'%(iris.data.shape[0], iris.data.shape[1]))
```

    ['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']
    [[ 5.1  3.5  1.4  0.2]
     [ 4.9  3.   1.4  0.2]
     [ 4.7  3.2  1.3  0.2]
     [ 4.6  3.1  1.5  0.2]
     [ 5.   3.6  1.4  0.2]
     [ 5.4  3.9  1.7  0.4]
     [ 4.6  3.4  1.4  0.3]
     [ 5.   3.4  1.5  0.2]
     [ 4.4  2.9  1.4  0.2]
     [ 4.9  3.1  1.5  0.1]]
    We have 150 data samples with 4 features


The data is always a 2D array, shape (n\_samples, n\_features), although the original data may have had a different shape. The following prints out the target names and the representation of the target using 0, 1, 2. Each of them represents a class. 


```python
print(iris.target_names)
print(set(iris.target))
```

    ['setosa' 'versicolor' 'virginica']
    {0, 1, 2}



```python
print(iris.DESCR)
```

    The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A Fisher
    
    This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
    pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and
    is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The
    data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
    type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
    latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

### Load Digits

This dataset is made up of 1797 8x8 images. Each image, like the ones shown below, is of a hand-written digit. In order to utilize an 8x8 figure like this, weâ€™d have to first transform it into a feature vector with length 64.


```python
digits = datasets.load_digits()
print('We have %d samples'%len(digits.target))
```

    We have 1797 samples



```python
print(digits.data)
print('The targets are:')
print(digits.target_names)
```

    [[  0.   0.   5. ...,   0.   0.   0.]
     [  0.   0.   0. ...,  10.   0.   0.]
     [  0.   0.   0. ...,  16.   9.   0.]
     ..., 
     [  0.   0.   1. ...,   6.   0.   0.]
     [  0.   0.   2. ...,  12.   0.   0.]
     [  0.   0.  10. ...,  12.   1.   0.]]
    The targets are:
    [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]


In the digits, each original sample is an image of shape (8, 8) and it is flattened into a 64 dimension vector here. 


```python
print(digits.data.shape)
```

    (1797, 64)



```python
## plot the first 64 samples, and get a sense of the data
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (8,8))
fig.subplots_adjust(left=0, right=1, bottom=0, top=1, hspace=0.05, wspace=0.05)
for i in range(64):
    ax = fig.add_subplot(8, 8, i+1, xticks=[], yticks=[])
    ax.imshow(digits.images[i],cmap=plt.cm.binary,interpolation='nearest')
    ax.text(0, 7, str(digits.target[i]))
```

### Load Boston Housing Data

The Boston housing dataset reports the median value of owner-occupied homes in various places in the Boston area, together with several variables which might help to explain the variation in median value, such as Crime (CRIM), areas of non-retail business in the town (INDUS), the age of people who own the house (AGE), and there are many other attributes that you can find the details [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/housing). 


```python
boston = datasets.load_boston()
print(boston.DESCR)
```

## The Scikit-learn Estimator Object

Every algorithm is exposed in scikit-learn via an ''Estimator'' object. For instance a linear regression is implemented as so:


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

**Estimator parameters**: All the parameters of an estimator can be set when it is instantiated, and have suitable default values:


```python
# you can check the parameters as
LinearRegression?
```


```python
# let's change one parameter
model = LinearRegression(normalize=True)
print(model.normalize)
```

    True



```python
print(model)
```

    LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=1, normalize=True)


**Estimated Model parameters**: When data is *fit* with an estimator, parameters are estimated from the data at hand. All the estimated parameters are attributes of the estimator object ending by an underscore:

### Simple regression problem

Let's fit a simple linear regression model to see what is the sklearn API looks like. We use a very simple dataset with 10 samples with added in noise. 


```python
x = np.arange(10)
y = 2 * x + 1
```


```python
plt.figure(figsize = (10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'o')
```

```python
# generate noise between -1 to 1
# this seed is just to make sure your results are the same as mine
np.random.seed(42)
noise = 2 * np.random.rand(10) - 1

# add noise to the data
y_noise = y + noise
