## Wife's painting: Cubism

My wife worked on two new paintings this week. I am impressed again and learn something new - [Cubism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism). It is really a cool idea that originated from paintings and inspired music, literature, architecture and so on. In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted formâ€”instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.

This is the original painting my wife drew. According to her, this painting clearly shows her nature and characteristic at home. When you first look at it, you will soon get the idea that she is doing shopping and cooking at home - these are her tools in daily life. You can see different materials in the painting, including wood, metal, paper, glass, plastic and brick wall. You can imagine the diversity of the food she makes, i.e. noodles, fried dishes, soups, etc. The only spoon that placed outside of the glass cup highlight the fact that she really enjoyed making soups - she has her own unique way to make delicious soups. The ones in the glass cup form a bundle of flower, which shows her love of life, and can find enjoyment from boring things. I know shopping and cooking take a large part of my wife's time (since I am not doing any of cooking at home), this is a big support for my study. Also, I am glad that she always seems energetic while cooking, which also affects my mood every day.

The Cubist version of the tools. Now we are not focusing on some of the tools. We start to see the same things but from a completely different viewpoint. According to her, this is real life - we can not always see perfect things. Most of times, we only see some aspects of an object that scattered in our life. Besides, this also means that various people will see the same thing differently, we should have a comprehensive understanding of the views that different from ours.
