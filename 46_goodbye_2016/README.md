The lovely 2016 will be soon replaced by new, unexplored 2017. Looking back, I did a lot of things this year, here are some numbers related to them. I will use this as a brief summary of my leaving 2016:

**1** - I built my 1st personal website - [Qingkai's site](http://seismo.berkeley.edu/qingkaikong/)   
**2** - 2 papers published ([Link1](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1501055), [Link2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070955/abstract))  
**3** - I taught 3 workshops ([python bootcamp](https://github.com/profjsb/python-bootcamp), [artificial neural network](https://github.com/qingkaikong/20161202_ANN_basics), [Mining Gmails](https://github.com/qingkaikong/berkeley/tree/master/python_mining_emails))  
**4** - My family will have the 4th member next year (I made it this year)  
**5** - I read 5 books from cover to cover

**7** - I spent 7 days a week    
**8** - I visited 8 places outside of Bay Area (Pasadena, New York, Reno, San Diego, Austin, Palm Spring, Yosemite, Lassen)  
**9** -  Attended 9 conferences (ShakeAlert Research meeting,  Seismology student workshop at Lamont-Doherty, SSA, Data science faire, Scipy, PyData, SCEC, ERA meeting, AGU)

**52** - All together, I wrote 52 blogs this year (including this one)  
**74** - I read 74 interesting scientific papers and write summary for each of them (started writing summary only in June this year)

**366** - I have 366 days this year (who didn't?)  
**1115** - I have 1115 commits on my Github!
