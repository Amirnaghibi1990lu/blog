**1** - We got $1 million for MyShake project  
**2** - 2 papers published ([Link1](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1501055), [Link2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070955/abstract))  
**3** - I taught 3 workshops (python bootcamp, artificial neural network, mining Gmails)
