As a graduate student at [Berkeley Seismological Lab](http://seismo.berkeley.edu/), doing pager duty is one of the things that accompany with you through your PhD study. Why called pager duty? You carry a pager with you and waiting for it to beep 24 hours for a week (The duty is rotating every semester). Whenever it beeps, you need sit in front of a computer, and working out the mechanism of the earthquake. This is a pager looks like:

Some of the young people may even don't know what is a paper, yes, we are still using it. It is amazing that there are still companies doing business with it. It has some advantages over the smartphone: the battery can last for months, it works at some places where no cell signal available, it is cool that we can show off to friends :-) etc. Overall, it does the job nicely. Like I mentioned, whenever this thing beeps, I need to work on the earthquake it reports in the next half hour to one hour, even in the middle of the night. Luckly, during my PhD life, I only got about 3 or 4 times that I need to do this 2 or 3 am in the morning. 

Ok, now you must curious what we will do after the pager beeps. Well, when it beeps, it means there is an earthquake larger than M3.5 in Northern California just now. Based on the waveforms recorded at seismic stations, a computer algorithm will generate a [Moment Tensor Solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_mechanism), which is a mathematical representation of the movement on a fault during an earthquake. This solution can tell us (mostly seismologists) how the fault actually moves. For the students' role, we need login a system, review the result and do a better version of Moment Tensor Solutions. Once the result is reviewed or a better version is made, we will publish it to USGS. It will on the USGS website as the following figure

If you play around a little bit on the USGS website, and you can find more details about the solution the student did, here's an example I did in 2013:

Don't worry if you can not understand what is showing here, it is designed for seismologists. And if you really wants to know how it works, you can read this famous [A student's guide to and review of moment tensors](ftp://ftp.geo.uib.no/pub/LarsOttemoller/1989_srl_jost_herrmann_mt.pdf). You can also check out the following video to get an idea of focal mechanism, which is a very close concept. You will understand how to read a beach ball.

I think it is really cool that we students can contribute to the USGS earthquake website and leave our names there forever (I assume USGS earthquake page will last forever, as long as we still have earthquakes). 

Anyway, the pager duty is part of our graduate students' life, and I believe that we will miss the feeling of doing duty in the middle of night after we graduate. 

### Fun facts
1. The pager will beep two times a day for testing purposes, noon and 3:30 pm. That's usually the time when we show off to friends or get curious looking on other people's faces. 
2. During one duty (7 days), students will experience 0 or 1 earthquake most of the time. Some lucky ones will have earthquake swarm during their duty :-)
