[Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) is an awesome tool that can make interactive maps built on [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). I found it very easy to use. I will create a series of blog entries to show some of the plots that I usually use for my research. 

Let's start with a simple map that change the tile to the style that USGS using for their earthquake page. I think the map tile looks good, here's an [example from USGS](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc72282711#general). Also, there's a good website that you can checkout different map tiles that can be used in folium - [Here](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/).
