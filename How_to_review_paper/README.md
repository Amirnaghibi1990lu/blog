I think how to review a scientific paper is an essential skill for a graduate student. But too bad, most of the time, we pick this up by ourselves during trial and error. I still remember the first time when I got an invitation to review a paper, I ask 'What should I do?'. 

I searched online, and read a lot of the other people's tutorial and articles, and slowly get the idea of how to write a good review (maybe too early to say, who knows I am writing good or bad reviews ^)^ but it is always good to learn and improve over time). I will put together of some useful resources I found online, and hope this will be useful to new graduate students. Also, if you have chance, ask your advisor or some senior researchers to do one or two review with you, you will learn better.

This is a very nice Q&A from different scientists. You will see different people handle the same question differently, choose the one that fit you.
