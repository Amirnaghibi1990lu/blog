    "We talked about the hidden neurons in the hidden layer, you may ask 'How do we select the number of neurons?' The way I select the number of neurons in the hidden layer is the 10 fold [cross-validtion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)). This is a very common way in machine learning community to find good parameters, it works as shown in the following figure. \n",

    "In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k − 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds then can be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the 10 fold cross-validation means I split the data into 10 subgroups, and use 9 of them training, and the other 1 to test the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other ways to select the parameters, like grid-search and so on. I will not talk here, since I like to use 10 fold cross-validation most of the time.   "
