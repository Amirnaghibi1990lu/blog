This week at [Berkeley Seismology Lab](http://seismo.berkeley.edu/) here, we have a competition to design a lab T-shirt for the Christmas party. I decided to design one as well. The following is my design about the T-shirt. 

## Back

The back of the T-shirt is our Berkeley Seismology Lab logo, with our two favorite color from UC Berkeley. This part I didn't design, it is just a copy of our own logo. 

## Front (version 1)

I was thinking to have some nice figures in the front, but my design skills are not so good, therefore, I decided to just put some text on the front. 'Questions about earthquakes' will show what do we do, and a good conversation starter, it has a meaning that we are the experts, ask us questions. 

## Front (version 2)

This version is a word cloud generated from our [mission and history page](http://seismo.berkeley.edu/seismo.overview.html), using the Berkeley blue and yellow, the things we do here at BSL are popped up. 

## Front (version 3)

This version is an equation, that we - Seismologist is made up of this 3 ingredients. And the '+ I + =' part is a small face by design :-)
