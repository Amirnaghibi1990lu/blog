I created this script for our earthquake of this week (There are some other scripts for different purposes, I may add them sometime later, but you can find them at my Github). The purpose of this script is that, a lot of times, when we look at an earthquake occured recently, we want to see the historical moment tensors in this region. These historical moment tensors can tell us a lot of things, i.e. tectonic setting, fault information, etc. Then using this script, all you need do is to specify the starttime, endtime, and region (for region, right now, I just use one recent earthquake location as the center, and expand them both in latitude and longitude a certain degree).
For example, the 2016 M7.8 Ecuador, if we want to see the historical moment tensors in this region, we can do as the followings. You can find the script on Qingkai's Github.
