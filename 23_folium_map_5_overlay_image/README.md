In this blog, we will try to overlay a static image to folium map. We will use the shakemap example from the 2014 [M6.0 Napa Earthquake](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc72282711#general). You can download the shakemap Intensity Overlay KMZ File, and get the png file after unzip it. The boundary of the image can be found in the overlay.kml file. You can find the script at Qingkai's Github.
