    "In [last week's blog](http://qingkaikong.blogspot.com/2016/11/machine-learning-3-artificial-neural.html), we talked about the basics of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and gave an intuitive summary and example. Hope you already get a sense of how ANN works. This week, we will continue to explore more of the ANN, and implement a simple version of it so that you will have a better understanding.\n",
