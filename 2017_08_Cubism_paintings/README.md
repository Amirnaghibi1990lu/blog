## Wife's painting: Cubism

My wife worked on two new paintings this week. I am impressed again and learn something new - [Cubism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism). It is really a cool idea that originated from paintings and inspired music, literature, architecture and so on. In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted formâ€”instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context. 

## Wife's tools at home

This is the original painting my wife drew. According to her, this painting clearly shows her nature and characteristic at home. When you first look at it, you will soon get the idea that she is doing shopping and cooking at home - these are her tools in daily life. You can see different materials in the painting, including wood, metal, paper, glass, plastic and brick wall. You can imagine the diversity of the food she makes, i.e. noodles, fried dishes, soups, etc. The only spoon that placed outside of the glass cup highlight the fact that she really enjoyed making soups - she has her own unique way to make delicious soups. The ones in the glass cup form a bundle of flower, which shows her love of life, and can find enjoyment from boring things. I know shopping and cooking take a large part of my wife's time (since I am not doing any of cooking at home), this is a big support for my study. Also, I am glad that she always seems energetic while cooking, which also affects my mood every day.

The Cubist version of the tools. Now we are not focusing on some of the tools. We start to see the same things but from a completely different viewpoints. According to her, this is real life - we can not always see perfect things. Most of times, we only see some aspects of an object that scattered in our life. This is also a metaphor in our life. Nowadays is an age of knowledge explosion, and we get information from different resources - such as friends, Internet, TV, radios... However, just like the tools in the second painting, this information is often scrappy and in disorder, even conflicting with each other at times. In this situation, everyone should screen and reorganize all the information we get in order to see the truth of our world. More important, when our conclusions are inconsistent with others, we should be more tolerant and inclusive. Because people from different culture backgrounds often see things differently. But that doesn't simply mean we are wrong or they are wrong. Only if combining all different views together rather than sticking to our own thinking, we can have a better view and understanding of our world.

At first, I thought the cubism can be done with random order. I talked with my wife, and she told me in every artist's mind, they have a rough idea of where to put different parts, and when they put this way, you feel it is natural and beautiful. If you put in a random way, you may not feel the beauty of the painting.
