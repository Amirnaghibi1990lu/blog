Recently, I am trying to experiment some deep learning models. I want to enable the GPU support on my Macbook Pro, since it can train the model faster. Here I document how I did it. 

### First check the specification

This is the Graphics on my Macbook Pro (early 2015 model), with OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.  

```
  Chipset Model:	NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M
  Type:	GPU
  Bus:	PCIe
  PCIe Lane Width:	x8
  VRAM (Total):	2048 MB

```
