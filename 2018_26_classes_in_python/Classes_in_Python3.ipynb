    "This week, I will give some examples of the [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) part of Python. The object-oriented programming has [many advantages](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-benefits-of-object-oriented-programming). And I really like them due to the reusability of the code and the feeling of modeling the world :-). I will give some examples that I usually use in my code as a quick guide of how to use these in your code. This tutorial serves as a quick guide, if you want to learn more, you should go to the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html). \n",

    "Typical python class has a constructor, that is the \\__init\\__() function, which initializes the class when you call it. This means that, when you first initialize your class, this function will be only run once. The 'self' means the instance itself, you can find a very [good explanation here](https://pythontips.com/2013/08/07/the-self-variable-in-python-explained/). The self.name and self.age are the attributes that the class will have, you can see from the following example. And the greet function is the method that we define in the class. Let's see how we can actually use it.   "

    "We can see from the above code that, we don't need to re-define all the attributes and greet function, the Teacher class actually have all these from People class, this is due to this line: **class Teacher(People)**, which basically say that we want Teacher class to get all the things from People class. This is called inherit, and class Teacher inherits from class People. And People is the parent class and Teacher is a child class. And then we could extend the methods in class Teacher by just define new functions. Or if we want to replace some of the old methods in People, all we need to do is to re-define the function, for example, in the following lines, we replace the greet method in People with a new one that greet the teacher.
